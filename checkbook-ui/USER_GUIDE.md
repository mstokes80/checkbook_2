2. Click the **users icon** in the account actions area
3. In the Permission Management dialog:
   - Enter the **username or email** of the person you want to share with
   - Select the **permission level**:
     - **View Only**: User can see account details but cannot make changes
     - **Full Access**: User can view and modify the account (future feature)
4. Click **"Grant Permission"**

### Managing Permissions

In the Permission Management dialog, you can:
- **View current permissions**: See who has access to your account

- **Change permission levels**: Update existing user permissions

## Understanding Permission Levels

### View Only Access
Users with view-only access can:
- See account name, type, and balance
- View account in their dashboard
- See the account in their account list

Users with view-only access cannot:
- Modify account details
- Delete the account
- Grant permissions to other users
- See the full account number

### Account Owner Privileges
As an account owner, you can:
- View and modify all account details
- Grant and revoke permissions
- Delete the account
- Enable or disable sharing

## Account Security and Privacy

### Data Protection
- Account numbers are always masked (showing only last 4 digits)
- Full account details are only visible to account owners
- Shared users only see information relevant to their permission level

### Permission Management
- Only account owners can grant or revoke permissions
- Permissions can be changed or removed at any time
- Each user can only have one permission level per account

### Account Deletion
- Only account owners can delete accounts
- Deleting an account removes all associated permissions
- This action cannot be undone

## Tips and Best Practices

### Account Organization
- Use descriptive names for easy identification
- Add descriptions to provide context about account purpose
- Use account types consistently for better filtering

### Sharing Guidelines
- Only share accounts with trusted individuals
- Regularly review who has access to your accounts
- Start with "View Only" permissions for new shared users
- Remove access when it's no longer needed

### Dashboard Usage
- Use filters to focus on specific account types
- Monitor your total balance across owned accounts
- Check shared accounts regularly for updates
