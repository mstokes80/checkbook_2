## Understanding Audit Logs

Every action related to account permissions is automatically logged for security and accountability.

### What Gets Logged
- Permission grants, changes, and removals
- Permission requests and their outcomes
- Who performed each action and when
- IP addresses and browser information

### Viewing Audit Logs
1. Go to your account dashboard
2. Click "View Audit Logs" or "Account Activity"
3. Use filters to find specific types of activity:
   - Permission changes
   - Specific users
   - Date ranges
   - Action types

### Understanding Log Entries
Each log entry shows:
- **When:** Exact timestamp of the action
- **Who:** Which user performed the action
- **What:** What type of action was taken
- **Details:** Specific information about what changed
- **Where:** IP address and browser information

## Best Practices

### Security Guidelines
- **Start with minimal access:** Begin with View Only and upgrade as needed
- **Regular reviews:** Periodically review who has access to your accounts
- **Remove unused access:** Remove permissions for users who no longer need them
- **Monitor audit logs:** Check logs regularly for unexpected activity

### Permission Strategy
- **Family hierarchy:** Consider your family structure when assigning permissions
- **Gradual upgrades:** Let users prove they need higher access before granting it
- **Clear communication:** Explain to users what their permission level allows
- **Document decisions:** Use the comment feature when approving/denying requests

### Common Scenarios

#### **Sharing with a Spouse**
- Grant **Full Access** immediately
- They can help manage all aspects of the account
- Consider making them a co-owner for equal control

#### **Sharing with Adult Children**
- Start with **View Only** for transparency
- Upgrade to **Transaction Only** if they help with bookkeeping
- Reserve **Full Access** for primary financial helpers

#### **Sharing with Elderly Parents**
- **View Only** lets them monitor without confusion
- **Transaction Only** if they're still managing their own finances
- Consider what level matches their comfort with technology

#### **Sharing with Financial Advisors**
- **View Only** provides transparency for advice
- Never grant higher access unless absolutely necessary
- Consider time-limited access for specific projects

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"User not found" errors:**
- Verify the username or email address is correct
- Ensure the user has an account on the system
- Check for typos in the username/email

**"Permission already exists" errors:**
- The user already has access to this account
- Use the "Edit" function to modify their existing permission
- Check the current permissions list

**"Access denied" errors:**
- Only account owners can manage permissions
- Verify you own the account you're trying to share
- Check that you're logged in with the correct account

**Users can't see shared accounts:**
- Ensure the permission was actually granted (check the permissions list)
- Have the user refresh their browser or log out/in
- Verify they're looking in the correct section of their dashboard

### Getting Help
If you encounter issues not covered in this guide:
1. Check the audit logs for clues about what happened

## Privacy and Security

### What Information Is Shared
When you grant someone access to your account:
- They see all transaction details and balances
- They see your account name and bank information
- They see historical data from before they had access
- They can see other users' activity in audit logs (names only)

### What Information Is Protected
- Your login credentials remain private
- Your other accounts remain hidden unless explicitly shared
- Personal information outside of this account stays private
- Financial data from other accounts is not accessible

### Revoking Access
- You can immediately revoke access at any time
- Revoked users lose all access immediately
- Previous activity logs remain for accountability
- They cannot regain access without you re-granting it

Remember: You always maintain full control as the account owner. You can modify or revoke any permissions at any time, and all activities are logged for your security and peace of mind.
